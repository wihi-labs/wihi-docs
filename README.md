**Old docs using Nextra, now archived**

## Contributing

1. Branch the repo (remember to name the branch appropriately)
2. Edit or add `mdx` files to the `pages` folder.

## Building Locally

1. ```bun install```
2. ```bun run build```
3. ```bun run start```

To run an `dev` session (where editing the files will automatically update the local session) instead, run `bun run dev` instead of `bun run start`.
