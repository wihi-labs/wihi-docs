# Trustworthy data storage

Eventually, all governance and the storage, and access of WiHi data and forecasts
will be managed by mechanisms deployed to the [blockchain](/fundamentals/blockchain.mdx).
Because interactions with the blockchain are transparent and mechanisms deployed are immutable,
(data) contributors to the platform and users can trust the fairness of the mechanisms and their permanence.
