# Market of ideas


The idea market is a tool of the WiHi DAO to facilitate the self-organization of its community. The community can crowdsource ideas/tasks leading to WiHi's success, organize, and fund their execution in a decentralized/ bottom-up way. It is a public board illustrating tasks that need to be performed.

The idea market extends the concept of crowed-financing by splitting the mandate of execution from proposing. 
Thus, it is a tool that facilitates bottom-up initiatives to be identified, funded and executed without requiring community-wide consensus.

## Mechanism 

The envisioned mechanism is illustrated in [WHIP-0004](https://github.com/wihi-labs/WHIP/blob/main/0004-idea-market.md).

In order to start the self-organization process of the WiHi [DAO](/community/onion), for the time being, the process/ tool will be modified such:

1. The community can crowdsource/ discuss ideas and tasks transparently in a dedicated discord channel
2. Core team enters identified tasks into a google sheet, evaluates if task has been completed and facilitates the rewarding
3. The excel is transparently shared with (subsets) of the community


## Motivation for the mechanism
DAOs started out as creative centers with a lot of activity. More recently, we have observed that these organizations are becoming increasingly bureaucratic. Improvement proposals in particular are a slow and energy-consuming mechanism to achieve decisions and activities within a DAO. 

In general, Improvement Proposals are a mechanism for collective intelligence answering the ("what should be done")[https://medium.com/coinmonks/complex-systems-part-2-managing-complexity-with-bottom-up-solutions-9d6fadd88cc4] within a DAO. The idea market is a mechanism for self-organization answering the ("how things should be done")[https://medium.com/coinmonks/complex-systems-part-2-managing-complexity-with-bottom-up-solutions-9d6fadd88cc4] within a DAO and thus will complement the improvement proposal mechanism within WiHi (WHIP-1). It is a lower-level tool that enables anyone to express ideas, to work on/ execute ideas, to fund/ support ideas, and to review executions of ideas. In particular, no DAO-wide consensus need to be reached on an idea (in order for it to be added to the idea market or to be funded or executed).

Thus, it is a tool that facilitates bottom-up initiatives to be identified, funded and executed.
