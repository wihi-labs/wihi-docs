# Supporter Rewards

Supporters make the third layer of our [DAO onion](/community/onion.mdx). 
These are individuals that actively and regulary support WiHis activities. 
Different supporter roles exist, currently we have experts ([WHIP-0005](https://github.com/wihi-labs/WHIP/blob/main/0005-expert-program.md)),
ambassadors ([WHIP-0003](https://github.com/wihi-labs/WHIP/blob/main/0003-ambassador-program.md)), 
and builders.

You can become a WiHi supporter in two ways:

1. You are approached by a WiHi supporter, contributor or core team member (your promoter)
2. You indicate your interest to support by filling out [this](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1Ba8TEbH8Ank7RUXCJZOtVrwYQIn0mS93MiVtm0av1a4) survey and be approached by the core team

Together with your promotor you will create an onboarding document in which 
the details of your involvement and rewards are illustrated.

Once this document becomes accepted by the DAO, you are officially a WiHi supporter.
