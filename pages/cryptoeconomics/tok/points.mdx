# WiHi Points
The WiHi Point (WiPo) is a test token for the WiHi platform and organization to try out different functionalities and features.

It is a fungible, transferable, uncapped and pre-mined test token that has no Source of value (see [this](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10586-021-03256-w) for definitions). Sources of value might be added over time. The sole purpose of the token is to test out functionalities and features of WiHis platform and organization.

In its first iteration, the WiPo will be used to test WiHi's community fund mechanism illustrated in [WHIP-0003](https://github.com/wihi-labs/WHIP/blob/main/0003-ambassador-program.md). In particular, it is controlled by a 3-2-multisig wallet, is filled with 2000000 (2 million) units and will be used to reward ambassadors, experts, builders and other emerging supporter roles (see [DAO onion](/community/onion)).
Hence, WiPos first usage is as a unit of account to keep track of the contributions of early supporters to WiHi.   
In particular, WiHi is a community-driven decentralized autonomous organization. In order to be able to scale the addition of new supporters to our DAO and track their contributions, we think the most efficient way to do this is with the help of an on-chain token.
