# How it works

Freely available public weather data is the baseline by which weather data gathered by private entities is measured against. If your data does not improve a forecast, by definition, it is _indistinguishable_ from noise.

> It is contrary to the health of the network to pay for noise with the network's equity (tokens).

## Token reward

Tokens rewards are commensurate to model improvement.
