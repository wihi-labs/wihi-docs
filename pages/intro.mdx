# What is WiHi?

WiHi provides weather and climate intelligence anywhere and anytime on Earth. Based on the values of decentralization, autonomy, co-creation, co-ownership, transparency and fairness, WiHi follows a community-driven approach that redefines the existing metereological ecosystem in such a way that existing stakeholders come together on the platform to share data and jointly create improved weather and climate forecasts for society.
