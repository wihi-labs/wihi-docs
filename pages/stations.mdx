# Overview
WiHi is a community-driven open-hardware initiative. We are open to all weather station devices. In order to be able to participate in the WiHi network, a 
weather station needs to be able to send its data to WiHi or be able to expose an API that can be queried by WiHi. 
In the following, we will list those stations at the moment contribute data to WiHi

## stations
- ECOWITT HP2553 (Dejan)
-- Weather stations sends data to Ecowit and WeatherDisplay dowloads data via API and sends them to WiHi FTP server

- Ecowitt HP3501
- Tempest WeatherFlow
- Davis Vantage PRO 2

- Netatmo Weather station
- Eurochorn EFWS 2900
- WS-0101 Digital Weather Station
- Oregon" model WMR 200

## Learnings

- Weather Display (https://www.weather-display.com/): Connects to weather stations, receives raw files can upload files (clientraw.txt) to a FTP server. Weather display can upload files
to several websites
-- Weather-Display Clientraw Parser (https://saratoga-weather.org/wdparser)
- querring real-time data from ecowit: https://doc.ecowitt.net/web/#/apiv3en?page_id=17
