# Connecting a weather station to WiHi

WiHi is a community-driven open-hardware initiative.
We are open to all weather station devices.
In order to be able to participate in the WiHi network, a weather station needs to be able to send its data to WiHi or be able to expose an API that can be queried by WiHi. 
In the following, we will list the different connection possibilities.  

## FTP

WiHi enables the sharing of weather data via [FTP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File_Transfer_Protocol). For this, a weather station needs to send its data to WiHiâ€™s FTP server.
The onboarding process looks as follows:

- Weather station operator fills out [this](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1VXQkadfNevLZrmhRV2XvjeH886yNzkhXj13whJOhk3U) survey
- Weather station operator obtains FTP server details and credentials from WiHi
- Weather station operator sends files per station owned via FTP to WiHi server

### Example 1: sending data via Weather Display 

You connect your weather station with your local server/ computer and send the data to WiHi via the [weather display](https://www.weather-display.com/) software (see image below).

Also other sofware like [WeeWx](https://weewx.com/) (which is open source) can be used to uploade files via FTP: https://weewx.com/docs/4.10/usersguide.htm#config_FTP 

### Example 2: sending data via Ecowitt cloud 
In case you have an Ecowitt weather station that sends data to the Ecowitt cloud, you can use their [API]( https://doc.ecowitt.net/web/#/apiv3en?page_id=17) to send the data to your server. From there you could 
use Example 1 to send the data to us, e.g. Weather Display can directly query the data from Ecowitt.
