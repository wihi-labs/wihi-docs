# Tokenomics

WiHi has a dual token model: $WIHI and $WNT. 

### Proof of contribution

$WIHI can be earned through measurable contributions to the WiHi network. Its value is supported by future revenue. There is no way to get $WIHI without putting in the work, like, for example, offering to invest. If you do want to invest, we have another token for that.

$WNT represents the value of the platform and is the tokens that founders and investors hold. Once the platform is up and running, $WIHI holders will have a right to burn $WIHI for the majority of $WNT. However, keep in mind that we do not promise to make $WNT tradeable.
