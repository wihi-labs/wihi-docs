# History 

The 1870s were a time of internationalization and globalization. It was a time of founding of the first modern, international organizations, including a very special one: the International Meteorological Organization (IMO). 
Preceding its founding in 1873, Prof. C.H.D. Buys Ballot, the first president of the IMO, laid out his vision that:

*"It is elementary to have a worldwide network of meteorological observations, free exchange of observations between nations and international agreement on standardized observation methods and units in order to be able to compare these observations."*

Since then, the IMO has grown up and so has humanity's understanding of internationalization. Today, meteorological sensors are connected through the Internet and administered by various organizations, including the WMO, the successor to the IMO.
