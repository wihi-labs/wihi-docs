# Community is everything

WiHi is a community-owned and driven initiative. We think this is the only way to address the
global weather and climate related issues we are currently observing as decentralized mechanisms such as collective
intelligence and self-organization outperform hierarchical/ centralized mechanism. Ultimateively these decentralized mechanisms rely
on the single nodes in its network and the relationships they form with others. 

Hence, in order for WiHi's collective intelligence and self-organization
to emerge, a diverse set of stakeholders have to contribute. In particular, it does not matter
if one is an expert, hobbyist, researcher or interested observer - all are needed to address our pressing
climate and weather related challenges.

We need you!
