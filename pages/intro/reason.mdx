# Why WiHi matters
 

## The macro perspective
 climate change: food, mitiation strategies
 extreme weather events: floods, tornados, rainfall


## The micro perspective
The existing weather & climate forecasting ecosystem is challenged by the following:


- **Challenge 1: Sparse data and models:**
Forecasting depends on two things: a) good data and b) good models. 
Nevertheless, at the moment we have neither good data nor good models everwhere.
In particular in regions such as Africa or South America,

- **Challenge 2: Siloed data**

- **Challenge 3: Varying Quality**

- **Challenge 4: Misaligned incentives**

## Challenges arise from missing links

In summary, what can be observed is that a link between weather data contributors, experts providing forecasts and consumers of weather data and forecasts is missing.
