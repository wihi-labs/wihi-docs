NOAA is composed of several line offices, each with specific responsibilities and focus areas:

1. **National Weather Service (NWS):**
   - The National Weather Service is responsible for providing weather, water, and climate forecasts and warnings for the United States. It operates regional and local offices across the country.

2. **National Ocean Service (NOS):**
   - The National Ocean Service focuses on providing science-based solutions through its programs related to coastal and oceanic conditions. It addresses issues such as tides, navigation, marine sanctuaries, and the health of coastal ecosystems.

3. **National Environmental Satellite, Data, and Information Service (NESDIS):**
   - NESDIS manages and operates environmental satellite programs, collects and distributes satellite data, and maintains a vast repository of environmental data. It supports weather forecasting, climate monitoring, and environmental research.

4. **National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS):**
   - The National Marine Fisheries Service is responsible for the stewardship of the nation's living marine resources. It manages fisheries, conducts research on marine species, and works to ensure sustainable fisheries practices.

5. **Office of Oceanic and Atmospheric Research (OAR):**
   - The Office of Oceanic and Atmospheric Research is NOAA's primary research office. It conducts scientific research to improve understanding of the Earth's atmosphere, oceans, and climate. OAR supports advancements in observational technologies and modeling.

6. **National Environmental Satellite, Data, and Information Service (NESDIS):**
   - NESDIS plays a crucial role in managing and operating NOAA's environmental satellite programs. It oversees the collection, processing, and distribution of satellite data used for weather forecasting, climate monitoring, and environmental research.

7. **National Geodetic Survey (NGS):**
   - The National Geodetic Survey is responsible for defining, maintaining, and providing access to the National Spatial Reference System (NSRS). It focuses on geodetic and geophysical activities to support accurate positioning and mapping.

8. **Office of Marine and Aviation Operations (OMAO):**
   - The Office of Marine and Aviation Operations manages NOAA's fleet of ships and aircraft. It supports scientific research, data collection, and operational activities conducted by various NOAA programs.

These line offices work collaboratively to achieve NOAA's mission of understanding and predicting changes in the Earth's environment and conserving and managing coastal and marine resources. It's important to note that organizational structures may evolve, and there may be changes or additions to line offices after my last update in January 2022.
