The National Weather Service (NWS) consists of several organizations:

1. **National Centers:**
   - These include specialized centers focused on specific aspects of weather forecasting and research. Examples include the National Hurricane Center (NHC), Storm Prediction Center (SPC), and Climate Prediction Center (CPC).

2. **Regional Offices:**
   - The NWS is divided into regions, each responsible for a specific geographic area. The regions are Eastern, Central, Southern, Western, Alaska, and Pacific. Each region has its headquarters and is further divided into Weather Forecast Offices (WFOs).

3. **Weather Forecast Offices (WFOs):**
   - WFOs are local offices responsible for providing weather forecasts, warnings, and other meteorological information for specific regions. There are numerous WFOs distributed across the country, and each serves a designated area.

4. **National Service Centers:**
   - These centers provide support services to the entire NWS. For example, the National Weather Service Telecommunication Gateway (NWSTG) facilitates the exchange of meteorological data and products.

5. **Office of Science and Technology Integration (OSTI):**
   - OSTI focuses on advancing the scientific and technological capabilities of the NWS. It plays a crucial role in research and development activities to improve forecasting and warning capabilities.

6. **Office of Observations (OO):**
   - This office oversees the collection and management of observational data, including data from weather stations, satellites, and other sources.

7. **Office of Operational Systems (OOS):**
   - OOS is responsible for the development and maintenance of operational systems used for weather forecasting and data dissemination.

8. **Office of Climate, Water, and Weather Services (OCWWS):**
   - This office focuses on climate services, water-related services, and broader weather services to meet the diverse needs of various sectors.
