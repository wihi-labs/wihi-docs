Key meteorological organizations in Europe:

1. **European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF):**
   - ECMWF is an independent intergovernmental organization supported by 34 European countries. It specializes in medium-range weather forecasting and conducts research in atmospheric science.

2. **European Meteorological Satellite Organization (EUMETSAT):**
   - EUMETSAT is an intergovernmental organization that operates meteorological satellites to monitor weather and climate from space. It collaborates with national meteorological agencies and the European Space Agency.

3. **European Organization for the Exploitation of Meteorological Satellites (EUMETNET):**
   - EUMETNET is a network of 31 European meteorological services that collaborate on various operational and research activities, including data exchange and the development of common standards.

4. **European Meteorological Infrastructure (EUMETCAL):**
   - EUMETCAL is a network that focuses on the coordination of meteorological education and training across Europe.

5. **European Meteorological Society (EMS):**
   - EMS is a non-profit organization that promotes cooperation among European meteorological societies, facilitates communication, and supports scientific research in meteorology.

6. **European Centre for Climate Adaptation (ECCA):**
   - ECCA is a platform that supports the exchange of knowledge and best practices related to climate adaptation in Europe.

7. **National Meteorological Services:**
   - Each European country typically has its national meteorological service responsible for weather forecasting, climate monitoring, and providing meteorological information to the public. Examples include the UK Met Office, Deutscher Wetterdienst (Germany), Météo-France (France), and the Royal Netherlands Meteorological Institute (KNMI).

8. **Norwegian Meteorological Institute (MET Norway):**
   - MET Norway is the national meteorological service in Norway, providing weather forecasts, climate information, and research.

9. **Finnish Meteorological Institute (FMI):**
   - FMI is the national meteorological and climate research institute in Finland, responsible for weather and climate services.

10. **Swiss Federal Office of Meteorology and Climatology (MeteoSwiss):**
    - MeteoSwiss is the national meteorological service in Switzerland, providing weather forecasts, warnings, and climate-related information.

These organizations work collaboratively through various European and international partnerships to advance meteorological science, improve forecasting capabilities, and address climate-related challenges. The list is not exhaustive, and there are many more organizations and institutions across Europe contributing to meteorological and climatological research and services.
