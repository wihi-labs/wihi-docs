# Sending data to WiHi

WiHi welcomes any and all data contributions regardless of the underlying hardware manufacturer. 

WiHi exposes a simple REST-based API (api.wihi.cc) for data contributions.

Hit the `/station` endpoint with a `POST` request containing your API key in the header as a bearer token. Your API key can be found in your profile. 

A sample `POST` request using `curl` that can be executed from any terminal looks like this:

```shell
curl -X POST 
	 -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY" 
	 -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"station_id":...}' 
	 https://api.wihi.cc/station
```

## JSON format

Each individual observation should be a JSON object with the following schema:

```json
{
	"station_id": "string", 			// your WiHi station id 
	"timestamp_start": "int", 			// start timestamp of the observation
	"timestamp_end": "int",				// end timestamp of the observation
	"precipitation": "float64",			// also known as precipitation_accumulated by some manufacturers
	"battery": "float64",
	"leaf_wetness": "float64",	
	"temperature_avg": "float64",
	"tempurature_max": "float64",
	"temperature_min": "float64",
	"relative_humidity_avg": "float64",
	"relative_humidity_max": "float64",
	"relative_humidity_min": "float64",
	"dewpoint_avg": "float64",
	"dewpoint_min": "float64",
	"midnight": "int",
	"pressure": "float64",
	"wind_speed": "float64",
}
```

Note that:

- the `station_id` must be specified, otherwise, the observation is dropped. `station_id`'s can currently be found
in the user profile.

- if the observation is a point observation, omit the `timestamp_end` field. Conversely, if the `temperature_end`
field is non-empty, then the observation is interpreted to be an (observation) range. 

- if the station does not contain a particular observation type, it can be omitted. For example, if your
station does not capture the `relative_humidity_avg` field, omit it in the observation JSON.


If the data from your station doesn't look like the above or if you're unsure of anything, please 
ping us on discord or reach out to us by email!
