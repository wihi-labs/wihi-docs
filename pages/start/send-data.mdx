# Sending data to WiHi

WiHi welcomes any and all data contributions regardless of the underlying hardware manufacturer. 

WiHi exposes a simple REST-based API (api.wihi.cc) for data contributions.

Hit the `/station` endpoint with a `POST` request containing your API key in the header as a bearer token. Your API key can be found in your profile. 

A sample `POST` request using `curl` that can be executed from any terminal looks like this:

```shell
curl -X POST 
	 -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY" 
	 -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"station_id":...}' 
	 https://api.wihi.cc/station
```

where the JSON containing the data has the following schema:

```json
{
	"station_id": "string", 		// your WiHi station id 
	"timestamp_start": "int", 			// start timestamp of the observation
	"timestamp_end": "int",				// end timestamp of the observation
	"precipitation": "float64",		// also known as precipitation_accumulated by some manufacturers
	"battery": "float64",
	"leaf_wetness": "float64",	
	"temperature_avg": "float64",
	"tempurature_max": "float64",
	"temperature_min": "float64",
	"relative_humidity_avg": "float64",
	"relative_humidity_max": "float64",
	"relative_humidity_min": "float64",
	"dewpoint_avg": "float64",
	"dewpoint_min": "float64",
	"midnight": "int",
	"pressure": "float64",
	"wind_speed": "float64",
}
```

If the data from your station doesn't look like the above, ping us on discord and we will gladly support your data!
