# Register your weather station

Weather stations must first be registered on the WiHI platform. Registering a station is necessary for:

1. Recording a station's metadata (location, manufacturer, model, etc) 
1. Obtaining a WiHi ID used to identify data contributions

### Guide
#### Step 1: Sign up

Signing up is easy at WiHi: just log in at [stations.wihi.cc](https://stations.wihi.cc), even for your first time. WiHi uses email-based authentication. We'll send you a magic link to log into the platform. 

#### Setp 2: Add a station 

In the [profiles](https://stations.wihi.cc/profile) page, find the "Add a station" button and fill in the following information for your station:
```json
{
	"name": "string", // what you call your station, a nickname
	"manufacturer_id": "string",	// id uniquely identifying station within a network (manufacturer or )
	"manufacturer": "string",
	"model": "string",
	"latitude": "float64",
	"longitude": "float64",
	"altitude": "float64",
}
```
